I'll update the navbar component to make the "Case Studies" menu item link to the "/case-studies" page.

```typescriptreact project="tech-consultancy"
...
```

I've updated the navbar component to make the "Case Studies" menu item link to the "/case-studies" page. Now when users click on "Case Studies" in the navigation menu, they'll be taken to the case studies listing page we created.

### Changes Made:

1. **Desktop Navigation**:

1. Modified the `NavItem` function to check if the label is "Case Studies"
1. If it is "Case Studies", the link now points to "/case-studies" instead of "#"
1. Other menu items still use the placeholder "#" link

1. **Mobile Navigation**:

1. Updated the `MobileNavItem` function with the same logic
1. The "Case Studies" link in the mobile menu now also points to "/case-studies"

# This change ensures that both desktop and mobile users can navigate directly to the case studies page from the main navigation menu, providing a better user experience and making the case studies section accessible throughout the site.

I'll update the Case Study detail page to include a Challenges section with three cards layout as shown in the image.

```typescriptreact project="tech-consultancy"
...

### 1. New Challenge Card Component

Created a reusable `ChallengeCard` component that:

- Displays a title and description
- Uses proper typography and spacing
- Maintains consistent styling with the rest of the site

### 2. Enhanced Case Study Data Structure

Updated the case study data structure to include:

- A `challengeSummary` field for the overview paragraph
- A `challenges` array with individual challenge objects, each containing:

- `title`: The challenge title (e.g., "Mobile Drop-offs from Slow Load Times")
- `description`: Detailed explanation of the challenge

### 3. New Challenges Section

Added a dedicated Challenges section that:

- Has a deep purple background that spans the full width of the page
- Displays a "Challenges" heading
- Shows the challenge summary paragraph
- Presents the three challenge cards in a responsive grid layout
- Maintains proper spacing and typography

### 4. Updated Content

Added detailed challenge content for both case studies:

- For "Retailer Conversion Boost":

- Exact challenges from the image: Mobile Drop-offs, Limited Re-engagement, Inconsistent Shopping Experience
- Matching descriptions for each challenge

- For "Global IT Platform":

- Relevant challenges for a micro-frontend architecture case study

### 5. Improved Page Flow

Reorganized the page structure to:

- Place the Challenges section immediately after the hero section
- Remove the redundant "Challenge" section that was previously in the main content area
- Maintain a logical flow from challenges to solution to results

# The Challenges section now closely matches the design in the image while maintaining consistency with the rest of the case study page.

I'll remove the testimonial and client information sections from the case study detail page.

```typescriptreact project="tech-consultancy"
...
```

I've removed both the testimonial and client information sections from the case study detail page. Now the results section takes up the full width of the container, and the layout is cleaner with just the essential information displayed.

The page now shows:

1. The case study hero section with title and description
2. The challenges section
3. The solution section
4. The results section
5. A CTA section at the bottom

# This simplified layout focuses on the case study content without the additional client information and testimonial sections.

2. **Navigation Links**:

3. Added proper `href` prop to the NavItem component
4. Made the Case Studies link correctly point to "/case-studies"
5. Added a Contact Us button to the desktop navigation

6. **Accessibility Improvements**:

13. Fixed dropdown toggle animations

14. **Code Structure**:

15. Made the component more maintainable by adding proper type definitions
16. Improved prop handling between components
17. Added consistent styling across mobile and desktop views

# These changes ensure the navbar works correctly, looks consistent with the rest of the site, and provides a better user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

I'll create a Solutions page with tiles and a solution details page:

```typescriptreact project="tech-consultancy"
...
```

- **Comprehensive Content**: Detailed information including:

- Features in a grid layout
- Use cases with detailed explanations
- Call-to-action section

### 3. Navigation Updates

- **Navbar**: Updated the navbar to link directly to the Solutions page
- **Back Navigation**: Added "Back to Solutions" link on detail pages
- **Internal Links**: Set up proper linking between pages

### 4. Data Structure

- Created comprehensive data models for solutions with:

- Basic information (title, descriptions, slug)
- Benefits list
- Features with title and description
- Use cases with title and description

This implementation provides a complete solution browsing experience where users can:

1. View all solutions organized by category
2. Click on any solution to see detailed information
3. Navigate easily between the solutions page and individual solution details

# The design is consistent with the rest of the site, using the same color scheme, typography, and component styles.

I'll rename "Case Studies" to "Projects" throughout the application:
