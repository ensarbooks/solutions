# AI Real Estate Agent

## Project Overview

The AI Real Estate Agent is an application that automates property searching and market analysis by leveraging Firecrawl's Extract endpoint and AI capabilities. It streamlines the property search process by aggregating data from multiple real estate websites while providing intelligent analysis and recommendations tailored to user preferences[5].

### Core Functionality

The application searches across multiple real estate websites simultaneously, including 99acres, Housing.com, Square Yards, and others, to find properties that match user-defined criteria. Beyond basic property listings, the agent analyzes location trends, calculates investment potential, and identifies hidden opportunities in the real estate market[5][7].

## Key Features

- **Multi-Source Integration**: Aggregates property listings from five major real estate websites in real-time[7]
- **Smart Property Search**: Uses Firecrawl's Extract endpoint to find properties matching specific criteria
- **Location Analysis**: Provides detailed price trends and investment insights for different localities
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Analyzes properties using OpenAI models to deliver structured recommendations
- **Investment Intelligence**: Calculates ROI potential for properties and identifies undervalued areas[5][7]
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean Streamlit UI for easy property search and results viewing

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The application is built using a combination of modern AI and web technologies:

1. **PropertyFindingAgent Class**: The core component responsible for property search and analysis
2. **Data Models**: Implemented using Pydantic for structured data handling (PropertyData, LocationData, etc.)
3. **APIs Integration**: Connects with Firecrawl for web data extraction and OpenAI for intelligent analysis

### Technology Stack

- Firecrawl API: For extracting property data from multiple websites[7]
- Agno AI: Framework for building and orchestrating AI agents[7]
- OpenAI (GPT-4o or o3-mini): For property analysis and generating insights[5]
- Streamlit: For creating the user interface
- Python: Core programming language used for implementation

### Key Implementation Components

The `PropertyFindingAgent` class implements two main methods:

- `find_properties()`: Searches for properties based on user criteria and analyzes them
- `get_location_trends()`: Extracts and analyzes price trends for different localities

## Using the Agent

### Setup Process

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Install required packages via pip
3. Set up API keys for Firecrawl and OpenAI
4. Run the application with Streamlit

### Search Workflow

1. **Enter API Keys**: Input Firecrawl and OpenAI API keys in the sidebar
2. **Set Search Criteria**: Enter city name, select property category (Residential/Commercial), choose property type (Flat/Individual House), and set budget
3. **View Results**: Review property recommendations with detailed analysis, location trends with investment insights, and expandable sections for easy reading[5]

## Output Features

The agent provides several types of analysis in its output:

1. **Property Recommendations**: 5-6 best matching properties with detailed information on each
2. **Best Value Analysis**: Comparison of properties based on price per square foot, location advantage, and amenities
3. **Location Insights**: Analysis of areas where selected properties are located
4. **Investment Recommendations**: Top properties with reasoning and investment potential[5]
5. **Negotiation Tips**: Property-specific negotiation strategies

## Conclusion

The AI Real Estate Agent represents a modern approach to property search that goes beyond traditional listing aggregators by adding intelligent analysis and investment insights. By automating the tedious aspects of property searching across multiple websites and providing market intelligence, it helps users make more informed real estate decisions[7].
