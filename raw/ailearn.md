### AI Learning Platform

I'll create an interactive learning platform with AI-powered features similar to what's shown in the image. This application will include a document viewer, interactive quizzes, flashcards, and an AI chat assistant to help users learn complex topics.

```typescriptreact project="ai_learning_platform"
...
```

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Learning Interface**: Split-screen layout with document viewer and learning tools
2. **AI-Powered Chat Assistant**: Ask questions and get immediate help with learning materials
3. **Interactive Quizzes**: Test your knowledge with multiple-choice questions and explanations
4. **Flashcard System**: Study key concepts with digital flashcards and track your progress
5. **Summary Notes**: AI-generated summaries of learning materials with downloadable content
6. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

The application is built with Next.js and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. It includes shadcn/ui components for a polished user interface and Lucide React icons for visual elements.

## How It Works

1. The sidebar displays available lessons that users can select
2. The document viewer shows the lesson content with zoom and navigation controls
3. The learning panel provides different tools:

4. Chat with an AI assistant to ask questions about the material
5. Quiz yourself with interactive multiple-choice questions
6. Study with flashcards that track your progress
7. View AI-generated summaries and mind maps of the content

# This application demonstrates how AI can enhance the learning experience by providing personalized assistance, generating quizzes, and creating study materials based on educational content.
