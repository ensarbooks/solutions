I need to implement GenAI features into the CRM system. This will involve adding AI-powered capabilities to enhance the sales process, customer interactions, and data analysis. Let me plan what I need to create:

1. AI-powered lead scoring and qualification
2. Smart email and message suggestions
3. Customer sentiment analysis
4. Sales forecasting with AI
5. Automated meeting summaries and action items
6. AI-powered search and insights
7. Content generation for sales materials

I'll need to use the AI SDK from Vercel to implement these features. I'll create new components and update existing ones to incorporate these AI capabilities.
