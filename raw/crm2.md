### Lead Management Application

I'll create a comprehensive lead management application using Next.js with the App Router. This application will include lead listing, details, creation/editing, and basic analytics.

```typescriptreact project="lead_management"
...
```

I've created a comprehensive lead management application with Next.js that includes:

## Key Features

1. **Dashboard Overview**

1. Summary statistics (total leads, conversion rate, pipeline value)
1. Visual charts for lead stages and sources
1. Recent leads listing

1. **Lead Management**

1. Complete lead listing with sorting and filtering
1. Detailed lead profiles with contact information
1. Lead creation and editing forms

## Technical Implementation

The application uses Next.js App Router with server components and server actions for data operations. For demonstration purposes, it includes mock data, but it's structured to easily connect to a real database.

# The UI is built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a modern and professional look while maintaining excellent performance.

### Adding Marketing Automation Tools to Lead Management Application

I'll update the lead management application to include marketing automation capabilities. This will enhance the application with email campaign management, automation workflows, and marketing analytics.

```typescriptreact project="lead_management"
...
```

# Marketing Automation Tools Added to Lead Management Application

I've updated the lead management application to include comprehensive marketing automation capabilities. These new features will help users create, manage, and analyze their marketing campaigns and automated workflows.

## New Marketing Features

### 1. Email Campaign Management

- **Campaign Dashboard**: Overview of all email campaigns with performance metrics
- **Campaign Creation**: Intuitive interface for creating and scheduling email campaigns
- **Email Editor**: Visual editor for designing professional email templates
- **Campaign Analytics**: Track open rates, click rates, and other key metrics

### 2. Automation Workflows

- **Trigger Configuration**: Set up triggers like new subscribers, tags, or specific actions
- **Email Sequences**: Create timed sequences of emails for lead nurturing
- **Conditional Logic**: Add branching logic based on subscriber behavior

4. Email template editor with drag-and-drop functionality
5. Marketing analytics dashboard with charts and metrics

# These features integrate seamlessly with the existing lead management system, allowing for a complete marketing and sales solution.

### Fixing the Resource Loading Error

The error you're seeing is related to an image resource that can't be loaded. Let's fix this issue by updating the code to use a placeholder image instead of trying to load an external resource.

```typescriptreact project="lead_management"
...
```

I've fixed the error by:

1. Replacing the external image reference in the landing page with a dynamically generated placeholder image
2. Removing the problematic image file from the project

The error was occurring because the application was trying to load an image file (`/lead-management-dashboard.png`) that wasn't properly available in the project. By using a placeholder image with the built-in placeholder service, we ensure the image will always be available.

The dashboard should now load correctly without any resource loading errors. The charts and data visualizations are generated using Recharts, which creates SVGs directly in the browser without requiring external image resources.

If you encounter any other resource loading issues, we can address them by:

1. Using placeholder images for visual content
2. Ensuring all assets are properly referenced
3. # Using SVG icons from Lucide React instead of external image files

### Adding Lead Scoring and Grading to the Application

I'll enhance the lead management application with a comprehensive lead scoring and grading system to help qualify leads based on data and behavior.

```typescriptreact project="lead_management"
...
```

# Lead Scoring and Grading System Implementation

I've enhanced the lead management application with a comprehensive lead scoring and grading system that helps qualify leads based on data-driven insights. This new functionality allows sales teams to prioritize high-value prospects and focus their efforts where they're most likely to convert.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Lead Scoring Dashboard

- **Score Distribution Chart**: Visual breakdown of leads by grade (A, B, C, D)
- **Scoring Configuration**: Dedicated page for setting up and managing scoring rules
- **Score Visualization**: Clear visual indicators of lead quality in the leads table

### 2. Detailed Lead Scoring Profile

- **Score Card**: Each lead now has a score card showing their current score and grade
- **Score Breakdown**: Visual breakdown of scoring components (demographic fit, engagement, etc.)
- **Score History**: Timeline showing how a lead's score has changed over time
- **Score Change Tracking**: Records of what actions triggered score changes

### 3. Scoring Configuration System

- **Scoring Model**: Configure weights for different scoring categories
- **Scoring Rules**: Create and manage rules that award points for specific actions
- **Lead Grading**: Define criteria for grading leads based on their fit with your ideal customer profile
- **System Settings**: Configure score decay, notifications, and integration settings

### 4. Lead Table Enhancements

# The lead scoring system is fully integrated with the existing lead management functionality, creating a seamless experience for qualifying and managing leads throughout the sales process.

### Adding Automated Drip Campaigns to Lead Management

I'll enhance the lead management application with a comprehensive drip campaign system to nurture leads with timely, relevant content based on their behavior and lead score.

```typescriptreact project="lead_management"
...
```

## Automated Drip Campaign System Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive drip campaign system for your lead management application. This feature allows you to nurture leads with timely, relevant content based on their behavior, engagement level, and lead score.

### Key Features

1. **Campaign Management**

1. Create multi-step email sequences with customizable delays
1. Set conditions for sending emails based on recipient behavior
1. Track campaign performance with detailed analytics
1. Pause, resume, or edit campaigns as needed

1. **Audience Targeting**

1. Target leads based on segments, lead scores, or custom filters
1. Auto-enroll new leads that match your criteria
1. Manage lead enrollment and removal

1. **Email Template Library**

1. Create and manage reusable email templates
1. Categorize templates for different purposes
1. Preview templates before selection

1. **Campaign Builder**

1. Visual workflow builder for creating campaign sequences
1. Configure timing between emails
1. Set conditional logic for email sending
1. Customize campaign settings

1. **Performance Analytics**

1. Track open rates, click rates, and other engagement metrics
1. Compare performance across different campaign types
1. Monitor lead progression through campaigns

### How to Use

1. Navigate to the Drip Campaigns section from your dashboard
2. Create a new campaign or manage existing ones
3. Define your target audience using segments or lead scoring
4. Build your email sequence with appropriate timing and conditions
5. Select email templates for each step
6. Configure campaign settings and launch

# This implementation integrates seamlessly with your existing lead management and scoring systems, allowing you to leverage lead data for more effective nurturing campaigns.

I'll fix the chart import error in the drip campaign performance component.

```typescriptreact project="lead_management"
...
```

The error occurred because we were trying to import `BarChart` from the custom UI components path, but it's not available there. The fix imports the chart components directly from Recharts, which is the underlying library for chart visualization.

### What Changed

1. **Fixed Import Statements**:

1. Now importing the chart components (`Bar`, `BarChart`, `ResponsiveContainer`, `XAxis`, `YAxis`, `Tooltip`) directly from "recharts" instead of from the custom UI path
1. If there's a custom `Chart` component in your UI library, we can import it as needed

1. **Component Usage**:

1. Using the standard Recharts `BarChart` component which is fully compatible with the rest of your code

# This change ensures that the drip campaigns page will render correctly with the performance chart displaying campaign metrics as intended.

### Implementing A/B Testing for Email Campaigns

I'll add comprehensive A/B testing functionality to your lead management system, allowing you to optimize your email campaigns through data-driven experimentation.

```typescriptreact project="lead_management"
...
```

# A/B Testing for Email Campaigns

I've implemented a comprehensive A/B testing system for your lead management application. This feature allows you to optimize your email campaigns through data-driven experimentation and statistical analysis.

## Key Features

### 1. Test Creation and Management

- Create tests for different elements: subject lines, email content, sender names, send times
- Set up multiple variants with a visual editor
- Configure test parameters like audience, sample size, and success metrics
- Schedule tests to run automatically

### 2. Variant Editor

- Create and edit multiple email variants
